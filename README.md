###  A social networking application that is geared towards bringing NBA fans together. 

## About Our App
   We have developed a social networking application that is geared towards bringing NBA fans together to watch
live events featuring their favorite teams at various sporting venues.

   This user friendly application allows users like-minded fans together at a central location instead of going to
multiple websites to find out about news relating to their favorite team.

  When going to the website __https://stormy-spire-61276.herokuapp.com/__ each user will be
issued an individual login through Google OAUTH to their personalised account.

   All user data will be stored in a SQL database. They can enter the NBA team the like, city they live, and the app will be
able to generate them places they can visit and content based on their team.

   When a user is authorized if they are new they will be redirected to a sign up page to gather team data. If they are a fan
they will see their homepage with the newest info.

## HomePage
When they are logged in they will see: 

* Colors of NBA team they chose under the nav bar.
* When a user logs in they see a Google map will feature all the venues in proximity that will be playing the game as
well the user’s geolocation.
*   A live Twitter feed will feature latest news from the user’s favorite team.
* A schedule of the users teams upcoming games within the next week.
* Additionally there is an events section that will further enhance user experience by keeping fans up to date on the latest action relating to their team(s).
* And a message board to post messages to share among fans.

* Use more stable API's to get more information on NBA Teams.
* Be able to expand this to more than basketball, including Football, Soccer, Hockey etc.
